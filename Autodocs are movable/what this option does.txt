This option allows you to construct your own Autodoc, but only if you've found one already.

Constructing an Autodoc requires an Autodoc Core, which can only be found by disassembling an existing Autodoc first. You can then construct a new Autodoc anywhere using this Core, but you must create an Autodoc couch directly adjacent to it for it to work.

This mod was designed so it works just fine even if you have the BioCo mod installed, which requires the same parts!
